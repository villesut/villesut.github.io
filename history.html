        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Coffee Bliss! Here’s our journey...</p>
        <<p>Coffee Bliss was founded in 2005 by the passionate and dedicated Smith family. Nestled in the heart of our community, Coffee Bliss began as a small, cozy coffee shop with a simple mission: to bring people together over a perfect cup of coffee. Over the years, it has become a beloved local spot, known for its warm atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious brews. The Smith family has always prioritized quality and community, sourcing the finest beans and creating a welcoming space for everyone. Fun fact: the Smiths are avid travelers and have visited over 30 countries, bringing back unique coffee recipes and brewing techniques from around the world! Today, Coffee Bliss continues to thrive, serving as a testament to the family’s hard work, love for coffee, and commitment to their customers.</p>
